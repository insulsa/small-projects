In retrospect, metabolomics should have been the highest priority of systems biology. The knowledge of the biochemical pathways that use and produce metabolites is extensive. There is a long history of successful application of metabolites as measured biomarkers (blood cholesterol, glucose, triglycerides), and the technologies to measure metabolites have been in place for decades, certainly long before sequencing and immobilized nucleotide arrays. Furthermore, variations in human health and disease as well as exogenous influences on health (age, pathogens, toxins, diet and drugs) are reflected in metabolism. The new strategy of measuring all, or subsets of, metabolites provides considerable advantage over focused single metabolite measurements

Focused metabolomic profiling in the drug development process: advances from lipid profiling
  2005
  Lipids are a particularly important subset of the metabolome because they are integrated into many aspects of global metabolism ...
  A considerable body of work is emerging concerning the profiling of the structural and energetic lipids.
  Directly profiling metabolites (metabolic profiling or metabolomics) has distinct advantages over other omics approaches in efficiently building knowledge of biological status because intermediary metabolism is proximal to phenotype, and because metabolites can be measured quantitatively and semi-comprehensively. 
  ... metabolomics has a decisive advantage over other <-omics> technologies because it is more proximal to phenotype.

  Extraction of grasshoppers abdominal secretion was done with Bligh and Dyer method。20 mg of biomaterial，Derivatization process was divided into two steps. Oximation was carried out for 16 h at room temperature with the use of 20L of methoxyamine hydrochloride in pyridine solution (15 mg/mL). Then, silylation (60 min at 97 ◦C in a thermoblock) was performed by addition of 20 L of BSTFA/TMCS mixture (99/1, v/v). The cooled down, derivatized mixture was diluted by admixing of 100 L of hexane to each sample and vortex-mixing for 2 min。
  注意事项：（1）the derivatization procedure was improved by a two step derivatization process。Oximation and silylation reactions resulted in obtaining more stable derivatives of metabolic components。

Lipids are essential cellular components that comprise a large number of chemically distinct molecular species.(1) The LIPID Metabolites and Pathways Strategy (LIPID MAPS) consortium (www.lipidmaps.org) has systematically defined and classified lipids into eight categories, according to their structural and biosynthetic complexity: fatty acyls, glycerolipids, glycerophospholipids, sphingolipids, sterol lipids, prenol lipids, saccharolipids, and polyketides, each with its own classification hierarchy.(2) Lipids play an outstanding role in diverse biological functions, including structural, energetic, and regulatory functions,(2) and have been shown to be directly involved in many human diseases, such as atherosclerosis, Alzheimer¡¯s disease, and cancer.(3-6) Therefore, the identification and quantification of lipids in biological samples could be of great interest to obtain in-depth knowledge of lipids function in biological systems and their involvement in the development of diseases. It is in this context that lipidomics appears as an emerging field that aims to analyze lipid species in biological systems. Lipidomics provides insights into the specific roles of lipid molecular species and also assists in identifying potential biomarkers.(5)

  Lipids were then extracted with two different methods. First, we used a widely used modified protocol of Bligh and Dyer (14)⇓ . Briefly, 400 μl of chloroform-methanol, 1:2 (v/v) was added to 20 mg of tissue homogenate and 5 μg of internal standards; 34:0-PA and 16:0-PI were added. After 10 min incubation on ice, 300 μl of chloroform and 200 μl of 1M hydrochloric acid (HCl) were added to the mixture and the lipids were isolated from the organic phase after centrifugation. The sample was vacuum dried (Thermo Savant SpeedVac), resuspended in 2 mL of chloroform-methanol, 1:1 (v/v), and used for analysis.

  Sphingolipids were extracted as described by the method of Sullards et al. (15)⇓ . Briefly, 20 mg of tissue homogenate was sonicated in 500 μl of methanol and 250 μl of chloroform spiked with 2 μg of C19-CER and 2 μg of C12-SPM. The mixture was sonicated at room temperature and incubated overnight at 48°C. After cooling to room temperature, 75 μl of 1M methanolic KOH was added and the mixture was sonicated for 30 s, followed by incubation at 37°C for 2 h. The solution was neutralized with acetic acid, followed by the addition of 1 mL chloroform and 2 mL water. The extract was centrifuged at 4000 g for 10 min and the organic phase was recovered. The sample was vacuum dried and used for sphingolipid analysis.

Serum or plasma
  The commonly recommended anticoagulant for plasma is disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetate (EDTA). Its use produces a shift of water from red blood cells to plasma, and therefore dilutes the plama and lowers the concentration of cholesterol. In the 1970s, its use was reported to lower the cholesterol concentration by 3% compared with measurements from serum, and in 1990 a difference of 4.7% was reported. The increase in the difference over the years was explained by a 50% increase in the EDTA concentrations in the commercially manufactured tubes (42, 43).
  A practical reason for the use of plasma instead of serum is the fact that plasma, unlike serum, can be centrifuged immediately after taking the blood sample. The time delay is not a problem for cholesterol and triglycerides, but may effect glucose levels, since glucose is metabolized by red cells. Plasma is also required if a survey collects information on fibrinogen.
