SYNOPSIS
this is a framework to watchdog resources , typically network connectivity
to run this , we have to make one test suit , for example
	#!/bin/bash
	source functions
	function probe { ping timeout $TIMEOUT_sec }
	watch

EXPLAINATION
the function `probe' is used as callback in parent function `watch' .
environment $TIMEOUT_sec is exported and must be honored . a single
probe must return zero on success and nonzero on failure . a single
probe who doesn't return within a reasonable time after $TIMEOUT_sec
is considered dead .
stderr of the prober is directed , maybe logged , by the watcher function .

BUGS
the `functions' and the prober shares same context , so mangling
variables can ruin everything . this is pathetic defect since bash
don't provide us with namespaces .
