i need a separated linewatcher
a tail-f dmesg does work and a ifplugd may worth a try
the previous stupid things just delete them
what i don't know now is the behaviour of dmesg , i.e.
on a link updown event is hard link or vlan showed ?

hi! iam in tongji now

that is very nice
still ip addresses are limited to their very rooms
howto decide which ip to use?
